## üí• Introduction

We introduce MAESTER (**M**asked **A**uto**E**ncoder guided **S**egmen**T**ation at pix**E**l **R**esolution), a self-supervised method for accurate, subcellular structure segmentation at pixel resolution. MAESTER treats volume electron microscopy(vEM) image segmentation as a representation learning and clustering problem. Specifically, MAESTER learns semantically meaningful token representations of multi-pixel image patches while simultaneously maintaining a sufficiently large field of view for contextual learning. We also develop a _cover-and-stride_ inference strategy to achieve pixel-level subcellular strueture segmentation.
